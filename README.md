##Proposal (6/22/2015)

All Android phones come with a built in Image Viewer of some kind. In most cases, it is the standard Google app, Google Photos. This app, and many others like it, is very well built and a solid choice for regular users. However, some users do not wish to put their photos into the hands of Google, or other large corporations, due to privacy concerns. In order to alleviate these issues, while still providing the same functionality, we propose to create an Image Viewing Gallery Application.

As explained above, our users are those that are conscious about the privacy of their images, and wish to avoid using an application that will sync to one of the major companies, and therefore make them susceptible to privacy issues. Therefore, the images will be stored locally on their phone, and the app will just serve as a gallery view of their images.

##A Typical User

As an example of a user, let’s consider a person, James. James takes many photos on his phone, but is skeptical of letting Google get his personal information. James connects to the internet through a private VPN in order to maintain a level of anonymity, and even avoids using any of the major e-mail providers. Rather, he has a domain in his name that he uses as his e-mail address. James is, to say the least, paranoid enough that he would be very interested in using an application on his phone to surf his images in a user-friendly format, without the worry of his images being uploaded in the background.

##Features

The app will have the basic features that gallery applications have, including viewing all images in the gallery, and swiping through images in the gallery in a large format. There will also be an option to view images that are hosted locally (at a URL of the user’s choice). The URL can be added to the viewer, and then the user can search for images on that URL. There are other apps that do similar things to this, such as QuickPic, MyRoll, and Cyanogen Gallery. All of these apps also serve as image viewers that act as a gallery for all the images on your phone.

##Libraries

Due to the limited amount of time that is available for this application, we will be using the standard components and features available in the Android SDK. However, we will attempt to incorporate as much in terms of material design as possible, using the Android Design Support Library.
